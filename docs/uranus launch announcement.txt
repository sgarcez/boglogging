The time has come. I hope you're sitting down.

You're surely thinking: "Today is the World Toilet Day, this cant be a coincidence". And you're right.

The DÃ©v Centre DAGGERS' Think Tank (aka the badass faction/guys with denim vests) came up with an automagical way of letting us all know if the upstairs toilet is vacant or occupied.

Now pick up you jaw, we wouldn't want it to be permanently dislocated.

You guys downstairs spoiled by your double toilet situation may find this frivolous but up here on the superior floor we go through a daily struggle trying to book a seat in the most exclusive of clubs - the bog.

Here's how it works, you can install a menubar icon in osx that looks like so:


Alternatively, or if you're not on a toaster you can access www.boglogging.com which will present you with a kindergarden level color representation the state of the toilet. The page will update itself, you don't need to refresh.

If I may suggest, that website is probably the best single use for a secondary monitor I've ever come across. 



It's a small and somewhat juvenile project but it will hopefully solve a problem (if minor) and it allowed us to play around with different technologies like physical computing, server-side magic and native applications.

We would like to guarantee that future incursions into URANUS will not carry any privacy concerns, but we're not in a position to do that.


This is the first DAGGERS production and it was programmed by Sergio and James. Simone did the designs, kanish supplied the wire and rachid was our SQL consultant.
